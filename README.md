Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

-----------------------
* Users can only like each picture once.
* Fix pluralize on likes.
* Picture reload (maybe using AJAX) at the bottom.
* Add Omniauth Login.
* Bootstrap or something similar.
* Unlike feature.
* Comments form displayed in line.
